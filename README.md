# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains materials for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project (see https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning).

### Data

The data used in the project is the [UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Before running the R code, download the data in the root directory.

### Files

`tidy-data-set.txt`. This is the tidy data set which is created by the `run_analysis.R` script.

`CodeBook.md`. This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations that have been performed to clean up the data.
